# Bookstack

[Bookstack](https://www.bookstackapp.com) is a simple, easy-to-use platform for organising and storing information.

This chart bootstraps a [Bookstack](https://hub.docker.com/r/solidnerd/bookstack/) deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

If `tls` is enabled, `cert-manager` needs to be installed.
